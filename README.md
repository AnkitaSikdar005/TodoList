## üõ†Ô∏è Installation and Setup

Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

---

### 1. Create a New React + Vite Project

First, install `tailwindcss` and `@tailwindcss/vite` via npm:
```bash
npm install tailwindcss @tailwindcss/vite
```
### 2.Configure the Vite Plugin
```bash
 // vite.config.js
import { defineConfig } from 'vite'
import react from '@vitejs/plugin-react'
import tailwindcss from '@tailwindcss/vite'

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [
    react(),
    tailwindcss(),
  ],
})
```
### Note: Make sure both react() and tailwindcss() are inside the plugins array.
### 3.Create and Configure Tailwind Input File
Inside your src/index.css, add the Tailwind directives:
```bash
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
```
#### This tells Tailwind to inject its styles into your project.
### 4. Install React Icons
Install React Icons to use a wide variety of icons:
```bash
npm install react-icons
```
### 5.Start Your Development Server
Run the development server:
```bash
 npm run dev
```
